  <p align="center">
  Application developed in OmniStack 8.0 similar to Tinder, but for developers.
  <br />
  <br />
  Profiles will be returned from Github, both on the web and mobile will be possible to LIKE or DISLIKE.
  <br />
  <br />
  The project contains the technology of Socket.io, which is a library that allows applications to communicate in real time, so if two developers LIKE each other, a message will appear on screen for both.
